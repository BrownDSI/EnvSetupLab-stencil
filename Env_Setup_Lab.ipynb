Your Brown username is what you use to login to Brown WiFi and other Brown websites. If you are unsure of your Brown username, go the Brown [directory](https://directory.brown.edu/), click **log in to view more information**, then search your name. After running the command, enter your GitHub password when asked.\n",

    "2. Now that you have created the repository for the assignment, you will need to download the assignment to JupyterHub.
